## Hello!

I'm a freshman at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology studying Computer Science and Engineering with interests in data science, machine learning, mathematics, and economics. I also enjoy sabre fencing, STEM outreach, and playing the piano.

I have experience coding in Python, and I am seeking summer 2019 internships. If you would like a copy of my resume, please feel free to contact me!
